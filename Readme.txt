On the third commit the simple menu was developed.
The program will read two files in parallel thread, and encrypt them using XOR algorithm.
Now, user can generate two files (possibility to choose files size will be added soon)
or find two files from the root drive
Note, that finding will not work with huge directories, 
so this function is not very comfort to use now. Also you can't open hidden system files.
